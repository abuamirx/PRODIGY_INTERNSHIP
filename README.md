Caesar Cipher Implementation
This Python script implements the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption technique. The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption algorithm used in cryptography. It shifts each letter in the plaintext by a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

Features:
Encrypt plaintext messages using a specified key (shift).
Decrypt ciphertext messages using the same key used for encryption.
Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.
Ignores non-alphabet characters, leaving them unchanged in the output.
